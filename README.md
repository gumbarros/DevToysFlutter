## Contributing
Check [CONTRIBUTING.MD](https://github.com/gumbarros/DevToysFlutter/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Motivation
I really loved the idea of the original DevToys, but I was upset that it only runs on Windows. I created this project with the aim of just being a port for Linux, but since it was written in Flutter, I think it's strange to keep it only for that platform.
